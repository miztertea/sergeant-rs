# ── Drain admission lock helpers ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# These functions implement the drain-admission lock used by sgt-respond and
# sgt-dispatch to serialize the "read drain state → start new pane" window so a
# concurrent sgt-drain cannot slip in between, and by sgt-drain itself to
# read-then-write drain state atomically.
#
# Outcome contract — shared by _sgt_drain_lock_acquire_fd and
# _sgt_drain_run_locked.  Callers can tell all three cases apart:
#
#   0  acquired     the lock is held        SGT_DRAIN_LOCK_STATE=acquired
#   2  timeout      another owner holds it  SGT_DRAIN_LOCK_STATE=timeout
#   3  unavailable  no usable lock location SGT_DRAIN_LOCK_STATE=unavailable
#
# A nonzero return ALWAYS means the lock is not held.  No path returns success
# without exclusion, so a caller can never proceed silently unlocked.
#
# Exclusion is a hard link, not flock(1).  flock is absent from macOS system
# installs and limited on BusyBox, and guarding it with `command -v flock`
# previously meant the whole lock silently degraded to a no-op.  link(2) fails
# atomically when the target exists, is available everywhere Sergeant runs, and
# — unlike mkdir — publishes the lock together with its owner record in one
# atomic step, so the lock can never exist in an unattributable state that no
# later contender is able to reclaim.
#
# Every lock instance carries a nonce.  Reclamation and release are both bound
# to that nonce, so a contender can neither destroy a lock that was reacquired
# while it was deciding, nor release a lock it no longer owns.
#
# Usage pattern (mirroring sgt-respond):
#   _sgt_drain_lock_acquire_fd N [purpose]        # 0 = held; 2/3 = not held
#   _sgt_drain_check_admission_locked [project]   # 0 = admit, 1 = draining
#   ... spawn new pane ...
#   _sgt_drain_lock_release_fd N                  # release
#
# The <fd> argument is an opaque per-process handle: it names which acquisition
# a later release refers to.  It is no longer a file descriptor carrying kernel
# state, because ownership is proven by the on-disk record instead.
#
# NOTE: because release is explicit rather than kernel-backed, a holder killed
# mid-flight leaves its record behind.  That is safe: the record always names a
# verifiable owner, so the next contender reclaims it automatically.  No EXIT
# trap is installed here on purpose — this library is sourced by scripts that
# own their own traps.

# pane or process must also call this function to prevent silent session leaks.

# the stop — the recorded id has been reused by an unrelated session, and
# stopping it would affect the wrong one.  This check is deliberately
# best-effort, not fail-closed: an unresolvable session_id (not yet persisted,
# jq unavailable, or the query itself failing) still calls stop, because the
# backstop's primary job — preventing a genuinely leaked live session from
# running forever — must not be defeated by an unrelated, transient
# verification failure.  Only a confirmed, positive mismatch skips the call.
