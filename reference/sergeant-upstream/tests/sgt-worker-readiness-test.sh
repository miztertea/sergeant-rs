# acknowledging is NOT misrecorded as orphaned (GH #175 AC5).

# Before this, bin/sgt-interactive-worker:257-260 looped forever on
# `_harness_ready || { sleep; continue; }` with no bound and no report, so a
# harness whose readiness could never be satisfied produced a silently spinning
# worker and, at exit, a misleading `orphaned` record.
