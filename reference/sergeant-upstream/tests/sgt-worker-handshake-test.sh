# Per-harness end-to-end notification handshake regression (td-db6323 / GH #175).
#
# tests/sgt-dispatch-worker-test.sh iterates `for agent in goose claude` but only
# asserts that prohibited one-shot forms were avoided and that `agent` was
# recorded.  No test reached .sergeant-notification-acks/<nonce>, acceptance,
# completion, clean exit, or relaunch for ANY harness — which is precisely why
# GH #175 went unnoticed for every harness except opencode.
#
# This drives the real durable handshake, for EVERY harness in the shared
# registry, twice: once for the initial notification and again for a response
# notification delivered to a relaunched worker.  The fake harness parses the ack
# token and both file paths out of the injected nudge text itself, so a change to
# the protocol wording or to the target paths fails the test rather than passing
# on state the harness read behind Sergeant's back.
