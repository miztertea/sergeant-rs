# Sergeant Documentation

Sergeant is a single-user, local-first project orchestrator for developers who
work across one or more related repositories. Each developer runs an independent
installation with local configuration, credentials, workers, worktrees, and fleet
state.

## Documentation authority

- `AGENTS.md` owns always-on agent execution and safety policy.
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` own trigger-specific procedures.
- `docs/schema.md` owns project configuration fields and path resolution.
- This documentation set owns user installation and operating instructions.
- Command `--help` output wins when the command implements it. Otherwise use the
  command's emitted usage/error contract and its tests; file a task when prose
  disagrees with released behavior.

Documentation examples must not contain real credentials, private repository
names, prompt bodies, response bodies, or secret-bearing environment values.
