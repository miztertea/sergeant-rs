# Product Requirements: Enforced Phased Dispatch

Status: Draft, awaiting explicit human PRD approval

Pinned source baseline: `348c2335526c00d40f7ec0bb4ef23d0650ce3a4d`

## Summary

Sergeant must turn a change-producing dispatch into a controlled sequence of
product definition, specification, and implementation. A change-producing
dispatch must not reach OpenSpec authoring until a human approves its PRD, and
must not reach implementation until a human approves its OpenSpec artifacts.
Sergeant must preserve enough durable, privacy-safe evidence to prove what was
approved, what was dispatched, and how interrupted work resumed.

This PRD defines the product contract for that lifecycle. It does not define the
shell implementation or create OpenSpec artifacts.

## Users

- **Requester:** states the desired outcome and receives questions, review
  artifacts, and completion results.
- **Human approver:** accepts responsibility for allowing work to cross a PRD or
  specification gate by personally invoking the matching approval command. The
  requester and approver may be the same person.
- **Coordinator:** the primary Sergeant session that creates and supervises the
  lifecycle, presents gates to the human, and reconciles phase results.
- **Phase worker:** an isolated agent dispatched for exactly one authorized
  phase and repository scope.
- **Maintainer or auditor:** diagnoses interrupted work and verifies the
  relationship among requests, approvals, artifacts, fleets, commits, and PRs.

## Problem

Today, a sufficiently broad dispatch brief can mix product decisions, technical
design, and implementation in one worker mission. That allows an agent to infer
consequential requirements, produce a specification nobody explicitly accepted,
or begin implementation while the source artifacts are still changing. Existing
worker statuses describe execution health, but they do not prove that product
and specification gates were satisfied.

The result is avoidable rework and weak accountability:

- humans may review implementation without knowing which requirements it claims
  to satisfy;
- agents may silently resolve product ambiguity;
- an approval may accidentally apply to bytes that changed afterward;
- retries may dispatch duplicate or out-of-order work;
- fleet cleanup may erase the only convenient account of how a request advanced;
  and
- logs may retain request or response bodies that contain private data.

## Product Principle

Planning artifacts are executable authority, not advisory context. Each
downstream phase receives only an explicitly approved, content-addressed
upstream revision. Agents can author and revise artifacts, but only a human can
authorize a gate transition or a phase skip.

## Outcomes

1. Product decisions are explicit in a PRD before technical specification
   begins.
2. OpenSpec artifacts are explicitly accepted before implementation begins.
3. Every implementation worker can identify the exact approved PRD and
   specification revision that authorizes its work.
4. Approval remains valid only for the artifact bytes the human reviewed.
5. Interrupted coordinators and workers resume without bypassing a gate or
   duplicating a phase.
6. Fleet and lifecycle records provide a durable, correlated audit trail without
   storing artifact bodies, prompts, responses, credentials, or secrets.
7. Existing active fleets and existing worker supervision commands remain
   operable during rollout.

## Non-Goals

- Defining the content schema of every PRD or OpenSpec document beyond the gate
  requirements in this PRD.
- Replacing OpenSpec, Git, treehouse, worker review, no-mistakes, CI, or
  repository-native tests.
- Approving an implementation, merging a PR, or declaring delivery complete at
  specification approval.
- Automatically deciding product questions or evaluating whether a human made a
  good decision.
- Providing cryptographic human identity, organizational authorization, or
  non-repudiation beyond the local actor evidence available to Sergeant.
- Migrating or retroactively gating fleets created before this lifecycle is
  introduced.
- Implementing the lifecycle as part of the work that authors this PRD.

## Terminology

- **Lifecycle:** one durable progression from a captured request through
  terminal delivery or cancellation.
- **Phase:** a bounded kind of work with its own permitted outputs and workers.
- **Gate:** a durable waiting point that prevents entry into a downstream phase.
- **Phase state:** the coordinator-level lifecycle state. It is distinct from a
  worker's `in_progress`, `needs_input`, `blocked`, `orphaned`, `done`, or
  `failed` execution status.
- **Artifact revision:** a manifest of one or more repository-qualified paths,
  one canonical Git commit per represented repository, and SHA-256 content
  digests. Its revision digest is the sole entry's digest for a single-entry
  manifest or the aggregate manifest digest for a multi-entry manifest.
- **Approval:** a decision recorded by a human's personal invocation of an
  approval command, authorizing one exact artifact revision to cross one gate.
  Sergeant enforces an interactive ceremony and records the local
  operating-system identity, but does not claim to prove that the actor is
  biologically human.
- **Skip:** a human-approved declaration that a normally required artifact is
  unnecessary under the eligibility rules below. A skip crosses a gate but does
  not fabricate an artifact.
- **Superseding revision:** a new artifact revision created after an earlier
  revision was approved. It requires a new approval and invalidates dependent
  downstream authority.
- **Lifecycle generation:** a monotonically increasing number identifying each
  durable phase transition or renewed gate publication.
- **Owning repository:** the repository where the lifecycle's PRD, canonical
  lifecycle index, and primary audit references live.
- **Source-request reference:** one of exactly four fields that identifies
  source authority without reproducing it: repository identity,
  repository-relative artifact path, Git commit SHA, or content digest. No other
  source-request identifier is permitted in output or retained lifecycle data.
- **Change-producing dispatch:** any Sergeant dispatch authorized to add,
  modify, delete, generate, commit, publish, deploy, or otherwise alter
  repository content or runtime state. Every `sgt-dispatch` invocation is
  change-producing unless the caller explicitly selects enforced read-only mode.
  Documentation and mechanical maintenance are change-producing; eligible cases
  cross gates through the skip rules rather than bypassing the lifecycle.
- **Read-only dispatch:** an `sgt-dispatch --read-only` invocation whose brief
  and worker controls prohibit repository or runtime mutation, commits, pushes,
  and delivery. Investigation and review may use this mode. A mutation attempt
  stops the worker and requires a new change-producing lifecycle; ambiguity
  defaults to change-producing.

## Lifecycle Model

### Phases and gates

- `request_captured` Permitted activity: Record lifecycle ID, owning repository,
  affected repositories, and permitted source-request references. Exit
  condition: PRD authoring is dispatched, an eligible PRD skip proposal is
  published directly to `awaiting_prd_approval`, or the lifecycle is cancelled.
- `prd_authoring` Permitted activity: A PRD worker may create or revise only the
  PRD and supporting review evidence, or may publish an eligible skip proposal
  instead of an artifact. Exit condition: A complete PRD revision or eligible
  skip proposal is published to `awaiting_prd_approval`.
- `awaiting_prd_approval` Permitted activity: Humans may review the published
  PRD revision or skip proposal; workers may answer questions or publish a
  superseding proposal. Exit condition: `sgt-approve-prd` records approval of
  the displayed revision or skip; cancellation is also allowed.
- `spec_authoring` Permitted activity: OpenSpec workers may create or revise
  only OpenSpec artifacts authorized by the approved PRD, or may publish an
  eligible skip proposal instead of artifacts. Exit condition: A complete
  OpenSpec revision or eligible skip proposal is published to
  `awaiting_spec_approval`.
- `awaiting_spec_approval` Permitted activity: Humans may review the published
  OpenSpec revision or skip proposal; workers may answer questions or publish a
  superseding proposal. Exit condition: `sgt-approve-spec` records approval of
  the displayed revision or skip; cancellation is also allowed.
- `ready_for_implementation` Permitted activity: Resolve repository
  decomposition, dependency order, and implementation assignments from the
  approved artifacts. After reapproval, reconcile existing workers before
  creating any replacements. Exit condition: Implementation workers are
  successfully dispatched, or matching paused workers are resumed.
- `implementing` Permitted activity: Workers implement, test, review, validate,
  and deliver only the approved scope. Existing worker status semantics continue
  to apply. Exit condition: All delivery gates pass, the lifecycle is cancelled,
  or an unrecoverable failure is recorded.
- `cancelling` Permitted activity: Prevent new dispatches, request termination
  of live workers, and account for each worker as stopped or orphaned. Exit
  condition: Every worker is proven non-live, then enter `cancelled`; otherwise
  remain nonterminal and publish a recoverable blocked condition.
- `done` Permitted activity: Preserve final references and outcome. No further
  dispatch is permitted. Exit condition: Terminal.
- `cancelled` Permitted activity: Preserve reason, actor, last valid artifacts,
  and worker disposition. No further dispatch is permitted. Exit condition:
  Terminal after `sgt-cancel` completes.
- `failed` Permitted activity: Preserve exact unrecoverable reason and recovery
  evidence. No further dispatch is permitted; continued work requires a new
  correlated lifecycle. Exit condition: Terminal.

The only normal forward sequence is:

```text
request_captured
  -> prd_authoring
  -> awaiting_prd_approval
  -> spec_authoring
  -> awaiting_spec_approval
  -> ready_for_implementation
  -> implementing
  -> done
```

A phase skip proposal enters the same `awaiting_*_approval` state as an artifact
revision. Approval of that proposal advances to the next phase; the skip does
not remove the gate. `cancelled` is reachable from any nonterminal state only
through `sgt-cancel`. `failed` is reserved for unrecoverable lifecycle
corruption or loss, not ordinary worker failure or a recoverable wait.

### Enforcement rules

- Each phase worker receives a brief limited to its current phase, approved
  inputs, permitted outputs, and repository scope.
- No PRD worker may create OpenSpec artifacts or implementation changes.
- No specification worker may modify the approved PRD or create implementation
  changes.
- No implementation worktree, worker process, or implementation assignment may
  be started before both gates have durable approval or eligible skip records.
- A worker's successful turn, commit, PR, or `done` status cannot advance the
  lifecycle by itself.
- Cross-repository implementation decomposition occurs only after specification
  approval, so all implementation workers receive the same approved authority.
- A transition must durably commit its new generation and audit event before
  downstream workers start.

## Human Approval Commands

### `sgt-approve-prd`

```text
sgt-approve-prd <lifecycle-id>
sgt-approve-prd <lifecycle-id> --skip --reason <reason>
```

The command must:

1. first return the existing approval without mutation when the same revision
   was already approved; otherwise require the lifecycle to be in
   `awaiting_prd_approval`;
2. show the repository identity, repository-relative PRD path, Git commit,
   SHA-256 digest, and downstream effect, or show the proposed skip category and
   reason; it must never display a source request or dispatch brief body,
   including a redacted body;
3. require an explicit confirmation from an interactive terminal, with no
   `--yes`, piped-stdin, environment-variable, or worker-brief bypass;
4. record the local actor identifier, timestamp, lifecycle generation, and
   approved revision or skip;
5. append a privacy-safe lifecycle decision event referencing the same evidence;
   and
6. transition atomically and idempotently to `spec_authoring`.

### `sgt-approve-spec`

```text
sgt-approve-spec <lifecycle-id>
sgt-approve-spec <lifecycle-id> --skip --reason <reason>
```

The command has the same interaction and audit requirements as
`sgt-approve-prd`, but presents the complete OpenSpec artifact manifest and the
approved PRD revision that authorized it. It transitions atomically and
idempotently to `ready_for_implementation`.

### Shared approval behavior

- The command operates on the canonical artifact manifest already published by
  the phase worker; callers cannot substitute paths or digests at approval time.
- Approval displays use repository identity, repository-relative artifact path,
  commit SHA, and content digest as the only source-request references.
  Privacy-safe downstream effect, skip category and reason, and local
  operating-system actor evidence are also permitted. Approval commands never
  display or persist source request or dispatch brief bodies, redacted or
  otherwise.
- For an artifact approval, the human must type
  `approve <phase> <full-sha256-digest>` exactly as displayed. A skip proposal
  has a SHA-256 digest binding its category, exact reason, lifecycle,
  generation, and scope; `--reason` must exactly match the published reason, and
  the human must type `skip <phase> <full-proposal-sha256-digest>` exactly. Any
  mismatch or other input leaves state unchanged.
- Repeating an approval command for the already approved revision succeeds
  without another transition and reports the existing event. A different
  revision requires a new gate generation and confirmation.
- A refusal or interrupted prompt leaves the lifecycle and all artifacts
  unchanged.
- The local actor identifier is the operating-system username and numeric user
  ID that own the approval process. Sergeant displays and records both while
  clearly stating that they are evidence, not strong identity proof.
- Agents and workers are contractually prohibited from invoking either approval
  command. The coordinator may present the command and its output, but the human
  approver must personally invoke it. The interactive ceremony prevents
  unattended advancement; preventing a human from delegating terminal control is
  outside Sergeant's enforcement boundary.

### Cancellation command

```text
sgt-cancel <lifecycle-id> --reason <reason>
```

Cancellation requires the same interactive-terminal and local-actor evidence as
approval. The command displays the current phase and all nonterminal workers,
then requires the human to type `cancel <lifecycle-id>` exactly. It atomically
prevents new dispatches, records a privacy-safe lifecycle decision event, and
enters `cancelling`; it then requests termination through existing supervision
and records each worker as stopped or orphaned. It enters `cancelled` only after
proving no worker is live. A worker that cannot yet be terminated or classified
leaves the lifecycle in `cancelling` with a recoverable blocked condition and
exact diagnostics. Repeating the command resumes or reports the same
cancellation without creating another transition. Cleanup becomes eligible only
after `cancelled` is reached.

## Artifact Immutability

- A phase publishes a canonical artifact manifest before entering its approval
  gate.
- Each manifest entry contains a repository identity, repository-relative path,
  Git commit SHA, and SHA-256 digest. Every entry for one repository in an
  artifact revision uses the same canonical commit. A canonical multi-file or
  multi-repository manifest also receives one aggregate SHA-256 digest over the
  ordered entries.
- Approval binds to the manifest and artifact bytes, not merely to a branch,
  path, PR, mutable ref, or latest commit.
- Before recording an artifact approval, Sergeant creates the same immutable Git
  ref name, `refs/sergeant/artifacts/<lifecycle>/<phase>/<digest>`,
  independently in every represented repository, pointing to that repository's
  canonical recorded commit. The approval transition fails without mutation
  unless all required refs make every approved artifact byte recoverable and the
  bytes match the manifest digests.
- Artifact refs are retained indefinitely by default, including after
  superseding revisions, terminal lifecycle states, and fleet cleanup. Sergeant
  must never move an existing artifact ref to another commit or delete it
  automatically.
- Deleting an artifact ref requires an explicit interactive human command that
  displays its repository, lifecycle, phase, digest, commit, and dependency
  status; records local actor and timestamp evidence in the append-only
  lifecycle audit; and requires exact typed confirmation. The command must
  refuse deletion while any lifecycle uses the artifact as active authority or
  any downstream artifact, worker, or delivery still depends on it. Append-only
  approval and lifecycle records remain auditable references but do not by
  themselves prevent deletion. A successful deletion preserves a tombstone
  containing the repository, ref name, commit, digest, actor, timestamp, and
  reason, but no artifact, request, or brief body.
- Any byte change, file addition, file removal, rename, manifest change, or
  commit substitution creates a superseding revision. It cannot inherit
  approval.
- Before every downstream dispatch and resume, Sergeant verifies the approved
  manifest. A mismatch returns the lifecycle to the corresponding approval gate
  with a new generation and blocks downstream work.
- If a PRD is superseded after specification work begins, its specification
  approval is invalidated and the lifecycle returns to `awaiting_prd_approval`.
  If a PRD or specification is superseded after implementation begins, Sergeant
  blocks new dispatches, moves active workers to `blocked`, and returns the
  lifecycle to the earliest invalid `awaiting_*_approval` state. After all
  invalidated gates are reapproved, `ready_for_implementation` reconciles and
  resumes workers whose approved authority still matches; nonmatching workers
  remain blocked until they are recorded as abandoned and replaced.
- Approval records and prior manifests are append-only. Superseded records
  remain auditable and are marked inactive rather than overwritten.

## Skip Rules

Skipping is exceptional and always requires the matching human approval command
with `--skip` and a non-empty reason. A coordinator or worker may propose a skip
but cannot authorize it.

### PRD skip eligibility

A PRD may be skipped only when the request is exactly one of:

- a revert of an identified commit or release, with no additional behavior;
- urgent containment that disables or rolls back identified behavior without
  designing replacement behavior; or
- mechanical maintenance limited to formatting, spelling, comments,
  generated-file refresh, or dependency metadata with no runtime, interface,
  security, privacy, data, operational, or user-experience effect.

Unapproved supporting material is not by itself an approved PRD and does not
qualify a product change for a skip. A pre-existing approved PRD is reused as an
immutable artifact revision rather than skipped.

### Specification skip eligibility

A specification may be skipped only when:

- the PRD was validly skipped and the work remains within the same eligible
  category; or
- an approved PRD completely prescribes a single-repository, mechanical change
  with no API or CLI contract change, schema or data migration, security or
  privacy impact, infrastructure topology change, concurrency behavior, or
  cross-repository dependency.

An existing approved OpenSpec revision is reused rather than skipped.

### Skip constraints

- Uncertainty about eligibility means the phase is required.
- A skip applies to one phase, lifecycle, scope, and generation. It cannot be
  inherited by a superseding request or expanded implementation scope.
- Skip records contain category, reason, actor, timestamp, permitted
  source-request references when applicable, and lifecycle generation, but no
  request or response body.
- Any later scope expansion invalidates applicable skips and returns the
  lifecycle to the earliest required gate.
- Emergency containment may proceed with eligible skips, but replacement
  behavior starts a new normally gated lifecycle.

## Fleet and Lifecycle Audit Requirements

### Fleet record

The fleet state is the operational source of truth while a lifecycle is active.
It must durably retain:

- lifecycle ID and schema version;
- project, owning repository, affected repositories, and permitted
  source-request references;
- current phase state and monotonic generation;
- phase transition events, including phase, generation, transition timestamp,
  and approved artifact digest or skip when applicable;
- artifact manifests and aggregate digests;
- approval and skip events, including actor, timestamp, and reason when
  applicable;
- phase worker IDs, worktree references, execution statuses, dependency order,
  and terminal results;
- recovery events, orphan diagnostics, invalidations, cancellations, and
  failures; and
- final PR and commit references when delivery succeeds.

Lifecycle events are append-only. Current-state summaries may be regenerated
from them and may be updated atomically, but must not replace the event history.

### Lifecycle index

- The owning repository retains one durable, human-readable canonical
  structured-field index for the lifecycle.
- The index may format only these enumerated fields: lifecycle ID and schema
  version; project; owning and affected repositories; current phase; phase
  transition entries containing phase, generation, transition timestamp, and
  approved artifact digest or skip when applicable; permitted source-request
  references; artifact manifests and digests; approval or skip actor, timestamp,
  category, and reason; privacy-safe downstream effect; phase worker IDs,
  execution statuses, dependency order, and terminal results; structured
  recovery, invalidation, cancellation, and failure state; and final PR and
  commit references.
- The index correlates PRD authoring, specification authoring, and each
  repository's implementation assignments without replacing their phase records.
- The index must not contain free-form or request-derived narrative,
  paraphrases, intent summaries, source request bodies, or dispatch brief
  bodies, including redacted bodies. Any source authority is represented only by
  the permitted source-request references.
- PRD and specification phase records remain awaiting approval at their gates;
  an artifact commit alone cannot close a gate. The matching approval command
  records the human gate evidence before advancing. A rejected or interrupted
  gate remains awaiting approval, while a superseding revision returns the phase
  to active work and requires renewed review.
- Implementation assignments must not start before `ready_for_implementation`.
- Fleet cleanup preserves the complete privacy-safe lifecycle event ledger and
  terminal downstream effect through the existing Sergeant capture mechanism
  before ephemeral worktrees or live fleet state are removed. Sergeant retains
  this capture indefinitely and never deletes it automatically; a user may
  delete it manually under their own retention policy.

Fleet events are the machine-operational record; the lifecycle index is their
durable human-readable structured-field view. A mismatch blocks phase
advancement and requires recovery rather than silently choosing one record.

## Recovery Semantics

- All transitions, approvals, skips, artifact publications, and response
  consumptions are idempotent and keyed by lifecycle generation.
- On coordinator restart, Sergeant reconstructs current state from durable fleet
  events, verifies it against the lifecycle index and artifact manifests, and
  resumes the existing phase. It must not create a replacement lifecycle or
  duplicate workers automatically.
- Existing `in_progress`, `needs_input`, `blocked`, `orphaned`, `done`, and
  `failed` worker semantics remain valid within a phase. A recoverable worker
  failure does not become lifecycle `failed`.
- An orphaned phase worker resumes through the existing response and session
  recovery path. If no resumable session exists, Sergeant may dispatch a
  replacement for the same phase only after recording the abandoned worker and
  proving that no live worker still owns the phase.
- A waiting worker remains alive until its response is durably consumed under
  the existing response-generation proof rules. Lifecycle transitions cannot
  treat a waiting status as completion.
- If an approval was durably recorded but downstream dispatch did not start,
  recovery verifies the approval and continues exactly once.
- If downstream dispatch started but its transition event is incomplete,
  recovery records the discovered workers, reconciles them to the intended
  generation, and either adopts the exact matching dispatch or blocks for human
  repair. It never starts speculative duplicates.
- Missing artifacts or digest mismatch leave or return the lifecycle to the
  corresponding `awaiting_*_approval` state and publish a recoverable blocked
  execution condition with exact evidence. Non-monotonic generations,
  contradictory approvals, or disagreement between fleet events and the
  lifecycle index leave the current lifecycle phase unchanged and publish the
  same blocked condition pending repair. `blocked` is not a lifecycle phase.
  Unrecoverable loss is required before lifecycle `failed` is valid.
- Cleanup refuses active, awaiting-approval, `cancelling`, blocked, or orphaned
  work unless the lifecycle first reaches a terminal state.

## Privacy and Security Constraints

- Fleet lifecycle metadata, lifecycle events, notifications, and terminal
  captures must never store PRD or OpenSpec bodies, dispatch brief bodies,
  prompts, model responses, `.sergeant-response` plaintext, credentials, tokens,
  environment dumps, or secrets.
- Across command output, fleet metadata, lifecycle events, notifications,
  terminal captures, and the lifecycle index, source authority is represented
  only by repository identity, repository-relative artifact path, Git commit
  SHA, and content digest. Downstream effect, skip category and reason, and
  local operating-system actor evidence are permitted non-source evidence.
- Project is permitted as privacy-safe operational grouping metadata. Mutable
  branch names are not retained in lifecycle records or the lifecycle index and
  are not source-request references.
- Skip and cancellation reasons must be concise and must not quote sensitive
  request content.
- Artifact content remains in its repository under that repository's access
  controls. Sergeant records references and digests only.
- Temporary confirmation and response plaintext is removed after durable
  consumption according to existing response transport guarantees.
- Notifications contain only lifecycle ID, repository identity, phase, and
  state.
- Files containing lifecycle metadata use least-privilege local permissions
  consistent with existing fleet state.
- Command output must redact credential-bearing URLs and known secret-like
  values before display or persistence.

## Compatibility and Rollout

- Fleets created before phased lifecycle metadata is introduced remain legacy
  fleets. `sgt-watch`, `sgt-respond`, `sgt-notify`, and `sgt-cleanup` continue
  to operate on them with their existing behavior.
- New `sgt-dispatch` invocations use the phased lifecycle by default. Existing
  project, brief, repository, branch, dependency, and supported
  execution-backend inputs remain accepted; the behavioral change is that
  implementation waits behind gates. Explicit `--read-only` dispatches use
  enforced read-only mode instead.
- Standalone status, context loading, graph generation, and fleet supervision
  commands do not dispatch workers and therefore do not enter this lifecycle. A
  dispatch that will modify or commit generated graph output is
  change-producing.
- Existing worker status strings and `.sergeant-status`, `.sergeant-message`,
  `.sergeant-result`, response ID, response acknowledgement, and gate-generation
  contracts remain unchanged within each phase.
- No project YAML migration is required to adopt the lifecycle.
- Unsupported or malformed lifecycle versions fail closed for phase advancement
  while remaining inspectable and cleanly diagnosable.
- Rollout documentation must state how users identify legacy versus phased
  fleets and how they recover either form.

## Measurable Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a new change-producing dispatch, no OpenSpec worker or worktree exists
   before a successful `sgt-approve-prd` event for the published PRD revision or
   eligible PRD skip proposal.
2. Given an approved PRD revision or skip, no implementation worker, worktree,
   or implementation assignment starts before a successful `sgt-approve-spec`
   event for the complete OpenSpec revision or eligible specification skip
   proposal.
3. Given an artifact approval prompt, only the exact
   `approve <phase> <full-sha256-digest>` confirmation advances state.
   Noninteractive invocation, piped confirmation, a missing or abbreviated
   digest, and a worker-brief attempt to bypass confirmation are rejected; the
   resulting event records the displayed operating-system username and numeric
   user ID.
4. Given the same approval command repeated for the same revision, exactly one
   transition and one authoritative approval event exist.
5. Given any approved artifact byte or manifest change, the prior approval
   becomes inactive, downstream dispatch is blocked, and a new human approval is
   required.
6. Given a qualifying skip, only an exact `--reason` match and
   `skip <phase> <full-proposal-sha256-digest>` confirmation advances state and
   records category, reason, actor, timestamp, scope, and generation; a
   mismatch, nonqualifying skip, or ambiguous skip is rejected.
7. Given scope expansion after a skip, Sergeant returns to the earliest newly
   required gate before additional work is dispatched.
8. Every implementation brief names the lifecycle ID and exact approved PRD and
   specification commits and SHA-256 digests, or the applicable approved skips.
9. Every phase transition is correlated across fleet state and the lifecycle
   index by lifecycle ID, phase, generation, artifact digest or skip, and
   timestamp.
10. Scanning fleet metadata, lifecycle events, notifications, and terminal
    captures finds no artifact bodies, brief bodies, prompts, responses,
    credentials, tokens, or secrets from phase fixtures.
11. Killing the coordinator before and after each durable transition boundary
    resumes the same lifecycle in the correct phase without a gate bypass or
    duplicate phase worker.
12. Orphaning a worker preserves diagnostics and permits exactly one adoption,
    resume, or recorded replacement path.
13. Artifact loss, digest mismatch, contradictory records, and unknown lifecycle
    versions fail closed with actionable recovery evidence.
14. Legacy fleet fixtures continue to pass existing watch, respond, notify, and
    cleanup regression suites without lifecycle migration.
15. Existing supported `sgt-dispatch` invocation forms remain parse-compatible
    and create a visible phased lifecycle for change-producing work.
16. Cleanup rejects every nonterminal lifecycle state and preserves the complete
    privacy-safe event ledger plus the terminal downstream effect before
    deleting ephemeral state.
17. Repository-native focused and full test suites, independent standards
    review, independent spec review, and required shipping checks pass before
    the lifecycle implementation is delivered.
18. Given any nonterminal phase, `sgt-cancel` requires exact interactive
    confirmation, prevents new dispatch, and records one idempotent lifecycle
    cancellation event. It remains in nonterminal `cancelling` while any worker
    is live or unaccounted for and permits cleanup only after reaching
    `cancelled`.
19. Every `sgt-dispatch` defaults to a phased lifecycle. `--read-only` rejects
    mutation, and an ambiguous brief cannot use read-only mode to bypass gates.
20. PRD and specification phase records remain awaiting approval at their gates,
    advance only through matching approval evidence, and return to active work
    when a superseding revision invalidates that evidence.
21. Every command output and retained lifecycle record uses repository identity,
    repository-relative path, commit SHA, and content digest as its only
    source-request references. It may also contain project as privacy-safe
    operational grouping metadata, privacy-safe downstream effect, skip category
    and reason, and local operating-system actor evidence. Fixtures containing
    branch names, other source identifiers, source request bodies, and dispatch
    brief bodies produce none of that data in output or retained metadata,
    including redacted body text.
22. Given a multi-repository artifact revision, every manifest entry names its
    repository, all entries for one repository use one canonical commit, and the
    aggregate digest binds the ordered repository-qualified entries.
23. Every artifact approval creates
    `refs/sergeant/artifacts/<lifecycle>/<phase>/<digest>` independently in each
    represented repository at its canonical commit before advancing, where
    `<digest>` is the artifact revision digest. Superseding, completing, and
    cleaning a lifecycle leave every ref unchanged; deletion requires audited
    interactive human confirmation and is rejected while any lifecycle uses the
    artifact as active authority or downstream work still depends on it.
24. Every lifecycle index renders only its enumerated structured fields.
    Fixtures containing request-derived narrative, paraphrases, intent
    summaries, source request bodies, and dispatch brief bodies produce none of
    that content in the index, including redacted body text.

## Delivery Boundary

Approval of this PRD authorizes only the OpenSpec phase for the lifecycle
implementation. It does not authorize runtime implementation. OpenSpec work must
use the approved commit and SHA-256 digest of this document, resolve
implementation design, repository decomposition, and dependency order without
changing these product decisions, and then await a separate `sgt-approve-spec`
decision.
