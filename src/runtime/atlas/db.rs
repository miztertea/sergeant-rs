//! The one owner of Atlas's database file (F2).
//!
//! ```text
//! <data-dir>/atlas/atlas.duckdb
//! ```
//!
//! This file is the only place under `runtime/atlas/` that names the `duckdb`
//! crate, and the [`Connection`] it holds is a private field with no
//! accessor — exactly the shape [`crate::runtime::analytics`] holds for the
//! operations projection, held independently for this database.
//! `tests/x1_atlas_substrate.rs` pins it structurally; that test is a
//! separate assertion from M5's, over a separate tree, because two databases
//! with one owner each is a different (and stronger) property than two files
//! sharing permission to open any database.
//!
//! # This file is not a projection (F1)
//!
//! [`crate::runtime::analytics`] opens its file by deleting it: the
//! operations tables are a pure fold of the journal, so the rebuild path and
//! the startup path are the same path, and losing the file loses nothing.
//!
//! **None of that is true here.** [`AtlasDb::open`] opens the existing file
//! and keeps it, because `source.*`, `git.*` and `meta.coverage` PERSIST
//! across restarts. They are derived from source bytes plus extractor
//! identity, keyed by SourceGeneration; no
//! journal replay reproduces them. A generation is evicted only when the
//! source bytes it was derived from changed, and the eviction is reported as
//! a coverage row rather than a silent gap (ruling §4). The journal carries
//! one compact `source.scanned` summary per completed scan so the
//! authoritative trail stays journal-side while the unit-level detail stays
//! here.
//!
//! Two consequences bind any later wave:
//!
//! * Nothing may delete this file to "fix" it the way a projection may be
//!   deleted, and no cleanup path may treat it as disposable state.
//! * The DDL below is `IF NOT EXISTS` because reopening an existing file is
//!   the normal path, not a recovery path.
//!
//! # Why the file is not under `projections/`
//!
//! The operations projection lives in `<data-dir>/projections/`, whose whole
//! documented contract is that deleting the directory loses nothing — an
//! acceptance test deletes it wholesale and asserts exactly that. A database
//! that must survive restarts cannot live inside a directory that is
//! advertised as disposable, so Atlas gets its own directory beside the
//! journal and the blobs, at the same level as `projections/`.
//!
//! # Scope today
//!
//! The four tables the local-knowledge scanner writes, and nothing else.
//! Every table lands in the wave that lands its writer (the empty-table
//! refusal doctrine); a declared-but-never populated table is a false
//! promise, not completeness. `git.*` and `context.*` are still empty
//! namespaces because nothing writes them yet.
//!
//! # The confirmation protocol (F1's crash window)
//!
//! `source.generations.state` is the whole mechanism, and every read in this
//! file filters on it:
//!
//! ```text
//! provisional  rows are written, the `source.scanned` summary is not yet journaled
//! confirmed    the summary exists; this generation is what coverage reports
//! evicted      superseded (bytes changed) or reconciled away (rows, no summary)
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing reads a `provisional` generation — [`AtlasDb::stage_scan`] writes
//! one, [`AtlasDb::confirm_scan`] promotes it, and [`AtlasDb::reconcile`]
//! evicts any that a crash left behind. That is what makes a half-finished
//! scan *neither-reported* rather than half-reported: the rows may exist for
//! a while, but no read path can see them, and reconciliation removes them
//! leaving a `generation_evicted` coverage row rather than a silent gap.
