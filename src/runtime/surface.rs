//! Work surfaces: isolated git worktrees per repository (proposal §11).
//!
//! Execution never happens in the source checkout. A Work gets a *surface* —
//! one git worktree per targeted repository, on its own branch, materialized
//! under the daemon's data dir:
//!
//! ```text
//! <data-dir>/surfaces/<work-id>/api/     git worktree on sergeant/<work-id>
//! <data-dir>/surfaces/<work-id>/web/     git worktree on sergeant/<work-id>
//! ```
//!
//! Each binding records exactly what §11 asks for: source repository, base
//! branch, base SHA, worktree path, work branch, current HEAD. Those records
//! are journaled, so the surface can be described, torn down, and rebuilt
//! after a restart without re-inspecting anything.
//!
//! Teardown retains the branch and removes the worktree — the branch is the
//! durable output of a run, the worktree is scaffolding. Teardown **fails
//! closed**: a worktree with uncommitted or untracked changes, a worktree that
//! has vanished, or a removal Git refuses is *recorded* in the teardown report
//! and left alone. Sergeant never destroys work it did not create.
